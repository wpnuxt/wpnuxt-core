## New Project

### Configure Wordpress

First set up WordPress as a headless CMS, by installing these 3 plugins:
 * [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)
 * WPEngine's [Faust.js](https://wordpress.org/plugins/faustwp/)
 * WPEngine's [WPGraphQL Content Blocks](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks) (you'll need to download the latest release as a zip file from the [release page on github](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks/releases) and install manually in wordpress)

#### WordPress permalinks

If you want to set up dynamic routes in Nuxt to match the WordPress slugs, then set the WordPress permalinks to postname.

#### WPGraphQL settings

* enable introspection

#### Faust plugin

* set the front-end site url
* copy the secret key
* depending on how you're going to handle image url's in Nuxt, you might have to enable "Use the WordPress domain for media URLs in post content"

### Add WPNuxt to your Nuxt app

Install the module to your Nuxt application with one command:

```bash
npx nuxi module add @wpnuxt/core
```

### Configure WPNuxt

Connect WPNuxt to your wordpress installation in your nuxt.config.ts:

```ts
wpNuxt: {
    wordpressUrl: 'https://wordpress.wpnuxt.com'
},
```
Include the protocol.

When you start Nuxt after adding the WPNuxt module, it might ask whether you want to install the @nuxt/image package:
``` bash
❯ Do you want to install @nuxt/image package?
● Yes / ○ No
```
